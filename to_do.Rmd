**4. US map: need to fix legends, labels etc, and maybe play with colors a bit**

**5. Cook County map: change the basemap/get better roads. Also either facet / do change over time or something about persistence of disparities to connect to recession? or cut it**

**6. County scatter that Alex liked okay but which is hard to understand. Think about the jitter approach, or using color to show something**

8. Change to area chart with monthly data
