1. probably fine as is

2. probably fine as is but could give encoding industry size another try in case Alex likes it

3. probably fine as is, too much work to modify, though facet row if anything?

**4. US map: need to fix legends, labels etc, and maybe play with colors a bit**

**5. Cook County map: change the basemap/get better roads. Also either facet / do change over time or something about persistence of disparities to connect to recession? or cut it**

**6. County scatter that Alex liked okay but which is hard to understand. Think about the jitter approach, or using color to show something**

7. change the labels so that they are color-coded

8. Change to area chart with monthly data
